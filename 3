Explain in detail:
‚óè All components of Hadoop 1.x: HDFS and map reduce are two pillars of HADOOP 1.X.And its components are divideed into two and they are:

a.)NAME NODE: It is a master node where various data's like location of data. Number of blocks in Data Nodes.Details regarding the slave nodes 
connected to them.
b.)DATA NODE: it will be 64MB in default.where it stores the data information received from the master node.

MAP REDUCE: It is a batch processing method where map reduction is used to increase the velocity rate.map reduction is sub-divided into two 
Components:

a.)Job Tracker:will assign map reduction task to the task trackers further into the cluster of nodes. and the task will be reasigned to 
other tracker when one node fails.
    And the job tracker is used to maintain the task tracker status like up/run.

b.)Task Tracker: The job tracker will do the task given by the job tracker.once the task is completed the status will be forwarded to the job tracker.
